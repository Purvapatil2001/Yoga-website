                            Yoga is deeply rooted in spirituality and many of the postures have deeper objectives that go beyond simple stretching
                             and strengthening of muscles. The holistic effect that is attained through yoga enables practitioners to not only
                              improve their physical strength and flexibility, but also their emotions, mentality and concentration.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This ancient science goes far beyond the mere physical aspects, by way of deepening the connection between mind, 
                            body and most important of all, the spirit. The spiritual aspect of yoga can help yogis develop integration of the
                             inner being as well as oneness with the Supreme Consciousness. And it all starts with the body and the asanas or postures.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In yoga, the nature and environment that surrounds us is essential, witnessed in the many Sanskrit and English terms for 
                            asanas (postures) that are derived from animals and plants, and that pertain to their special characteristics or qualities,
                             such as the Lotus for example. Apart from these, some receive their inspiration from the Earth and others have their roots
                              in ancient spirituality. However, each name has a deeper, hidden meaning
                        </p>

                        <div class="spi-1">
                            <h4>Padmasana – Lotus Pose</h4>
                            <img src="lotus.png" alt="" class="src">

                            <p>
                                In the ancient traditions of Asia, the lotus flower is often a symbol of purity and “spontaneous” generation,
                                representing divine birth, spiritual development and creation itself. A lotus flower is on a journey from its
                                roots embedded in the muddy waters, stemming upward, emerging into the light and blooming into the beautiful
                                flower we know it to be. Symbolically it represents the perfection of the human being, who is with her body 
                                or “roots” in the world (like the roots of the lotus in the mud of the lake), but with her mind dwelling in
                                    the Divine, such as the lotus blooming above the surface of the water. When the lotus pose is perfected one 
                                    attains complete detachment which is symbolized by the petals of the lotus flower. When splashing water onto
                                    the lotus petals, the droplets will roll off the petals and will never stick to them. Similarly the yogi will
                                    not remain attached to anything in the world even though he is “drenched” with the water of the world.
                            </p>
                        

                            <p>
                                The Lotus Pose is the regular seated meditation posture yogis assume for meditation and pranayama (breathing exercises). 
                                Breath is an energizing and purifying aspect for the human body. Deep, slow breathing energizes and purifies our bodies. 
                                Yoga practice helps us tune into our self, allowing us to discover our true nature and exquisite potential.

                            <h4>Viirabhadrasana – Warrior Pose</h4>
                            <img src="virabhadrasana.png" alt="" class="src">

                            <p>
                                Yogic philosophy has it that one’s biggest enemy is self-ignorance. Being ignorant or not fully aware of yourself 
                                can cause intense suffering for yourself and others. The Warrior posture allows one to embody the idea of courage,
                                bravery and strength necessary to face your own inner demons – overcoming ego and ignorance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The 3 primary Warrior poses in yoga all involve strong extended legs pressing into the ground, powerfully extended 
                                arms and an active, engaged core. The Warrior posture helps your body develop not only physical strength, but also 
                                the spiritual readiness for the inner battles that the mind and heart must wage and win.

                            <h4>Balasana – Child’s Pose</h4>
                            <img src="balasana.jpg" alt="" class="src">

                            <p>
                                It seems to be one of the simpler poses, yet there is more to the child’s pose than meets the eye. In this pose, 
                                you kneel on the ground with your legs tucked underneath, your torso resting on the thighs, arms by your side or
                                stretched forward and palms resting on the floor. This posture symbolizes and intensifies your connection to the 
                                childlike attitude of surrender.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The goal of this exercise is to be in a state of non-doing, especially important if you are tense, 
                                highly-strung or stressed out. This posture is about creating a shell of quiet tranquility, allowing the 
                                spirit to rest and nurture itself, removed from external pressures. The emphasis on proper breathing in
                                this posture further strengthens the connection between mind and body, inducing a state of calm awareness
                                that helps you to fully relax. You allow yourself some quiet time for your mind, heart and body to integrate, 
                                resulting in a state of deeply satisfying wholeness.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Vrkshasana – Tree Pose</h4>
                            <img src="vrakshasana.jpg" alt="" class="src">

                            <p>
                                A popular asana practiced in yoga, the objective of the Tree Pose is to achieve balance. However, in this instance
                                balance is not achieved in a rigid manner, but much like a tree. Your foot stays rooted in the ground while your
                                body may gently and almost imperceptibly sway, like a tree does in the wind. The freedom of movement coupled with
                                balance and being rooted develops the spiritual acceptance of your body’s firm, yet transient position in the world.
                            </p>
                        </div>


                        <div class="spi-1">
                            <h4>Shavasana – Corpse Pose</h4>
                            <img src="shavasana.jpg" alt="" class="src">
                            
                            <p>
                                Most yoga sessions end with Shavasana, or the “Corpse Pose.” It’s a relaxation pose, performed while lying on your 
                                back with your eyes closed and your arms extended alongside your body. This asana requires your body to be completely 
                                still so your mind can be drawn inward, allowing you to indulge your inner self without any distractions, be it 
                                movement or thought.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The spiritual aspect of the posture invokes surrender, giving up one’s intentions, goals and worldly pursuits in 
                                acknowledgement of the fact that there is a sense of completion and peace to be found in mere stillness and 
                                tranquility. It’s important to remember that the yogic version of death is seen as the culmination of one’s life, 
                                making it highly important for all. This posture mimics death in a manner that helps you prepare for the inevitable 
                                end that awaits us all. And to prepare you knowing that death is a state of utter relaxation, as if relaxing into one’s
                                own Self. There are three ways to relax: physical relaxation, when the body is still and the muscles fully relaxed, 
                                mental relaxation, when the mind is unruffled by thoughts and emotions and finally, spiritual relaxation, when the mind 
                                merges in the inner spiritual Self.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

                        <p>
                            A good yoga practice is one that allows its practitioners to achieve peace – with themselves and the external world 
                            they inhabit. The spiritual aspect of yoga emphasizes the attainment of peace and clarity of mind, while perfecting
                             the posture is of secondary importance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Practicing yoga with this ultimate objective will eventually lead to spiritual fulfillment, a state of great bliss.
                             The practice of yoga aimed at total integration includes a certain lifestyle, the practice of compassion and kindness, 
                             a vegetarian or vegan diet, and all of this plays an important role in the fulfillment of the above objective.
